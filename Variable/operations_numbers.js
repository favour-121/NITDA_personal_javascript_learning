// HOW to use variables to add Numbers
 //First we declear a variable 
 //Then we assign the variable 
 //Then we work with our operations (addtion,subtraction,multiplication,division Boolean,e.t.c)

 var a = 64;//here we assigned and decleared a variable at the same time 
 var b = 75;
 var d = 64;
 var e = 8;
 var sum = a + b;
 var div = d/e;
 var mul = a * b
 console.log(`The sum of ${a} + ${b} = ${sum}`);//The sum of 64 + 75 = 139
 console.log(`Division ${d} / ${e} = ${div}`);//Division 64 / 8 = 8
 console.log(`Multiplication ${a} * ${b} = ${mul}`);//Multiplication 64 * 75 = 4800
