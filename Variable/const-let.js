//making use of const and let keyword
// A const keyword is a type of variable that cannot be changed

const Apple = 5;
const Ball = 6; 
console.log(Apple)//5
//if we try to redeclear it  will give us error
/*Apple = 7;//SyntaxError: Identifier 'Apple' has already been declared
console.log(Apple)*/

//let as the same usage with the var keyword 
let a = "apple"
let b = "coke"
console.log(`I love ${a} and i hate ${b} `)//I love apple and i hate coke
